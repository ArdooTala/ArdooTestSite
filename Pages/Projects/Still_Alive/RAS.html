                <p>In order to close the gap between the physical and the digital world,
                    all the pieces of scrap wood are scanned and interpreted through an
                    automated process. For this reason, an aerial picture is taken using
                    a drone of the scrap pieces. This picture is then analysed using
                    computer-vision algorithms using OpenCV for python in order to
                    vectorize the data which enables further use of it in CAD programs
                    for further interventions.</p>

                                <p>This solution is proposed to find the best position and orientation of the gripper to grip a piece of scrap-wood (Target) of an arbitrary shape. <br> Considering each of the three suction cups on the gripper, the 2D polygon of “target” shape represents the sub-vector space, in a coordinate system origined at the center of that suction-cup (CS1, CS2, CS3), that will translate the center of that suction-cup into the polygon. By moving these sub-vector spaces into a shared coordinate-system (CS0), there will be three sub-vector spaces that each moves one of the suction-cups into the polygon. Obviously, the intersection of these three sub-vector spaces (VSC), if there is any, will move all three suction-cups into the polygon. Any vector starting from the origin (CS0) and ending inside VSC will bring the centers into the polygon, yet, the size of the suction-cup is to be considered as the suction-cup will not hold the piece unless the suction-cup is fully covered. The best vector in this sub-vector space will be the vector that will give the most possible margin to the cups. to find this vector, the point inside the VSC that has the maximum distance from the edges (Vt) should be find. This can be interpreted as finding the biggest circle (C) that fits through the VSC. Normally, such a circle should be tangent to at least three of the edges. To find such a circle, the medial-axis of the polygon is extracted and all the intersection points on the medial axises are extracted. <br> These points are the points with maximum dustance from at leat three edges. By checking the distance between each of them and the polygon, the biggest circle can be extracted with rather low computational complexity. <br> In order to find the best orientation, the previous step should be tested in different angles of rotation. To find the best angle, a few evenly distributed angles (5 in this case) over an span of 120 degrees (as the tool is symmetric) are tested first, the best angle is found and the test will be repeated over a smaller span around that angle. This step is repeated for 7 times to find the proper orientation. </p>
