                <p>‘Still Alive’ is a data based process to produce new solutions from waste material. Using computer vision, autonomous fabrication, robotics, and generative design process our aim to convert existing ‘waste’ materials to a resource based on the upcycling process. ‘Still Alive’ is the new way solution to transform un-standard material of waste into a new resource for the construction sector. Rather than to use extra energy, cost, and chemical process on natural material, we upcycle the material in energy-intensive processes. Our solution is adding value on the waste material through a process of ‘autonomous’ 3D scanning and robotic fabrication.</p>

                <h5>WHY IS THE WASTE A PROBLEM?</h5>
                    <p>Industrial waste is the waste produced by industrial activity which includes any material that is rendered useless during a manufacturing process such as that of factories, industries, mills, and mining operations. Types of industrial waste include dirt and gravel, masonry and concrete, scrap metal, oil, solvents, chemicals, scrap lumber, even vegetable matter from restaurants.<br> The wastes represent a major problem for the environment because the air pollution (the dust and very fine particles which spread in the atmosphere) and leaching toxic chemicals when are dumped in landfills, quarries, rivers or oceans. The capitalization of waste is difficult because of their variety, as well as their unknown properties over time.<br> Lately, environmental sustainability became an important problem from the point of view of natural resources and that of wastes. The construction and the building materials sectors are involved in both processes: building industry is the largest user of natural materials and in addition, a large amount of wastes results from the demolition of constructions.

In the implementation of a building construction project, it can be avoided the residual of construction material or commonly called construction waste. Besides effects on the cost, construction waste also affects to the environmental. Some of the notable research included that the EPA estimates demolished buildings contribute 1 Billion feet of usable lumber per year. It also states that 58% of that timber would end up in the landfill. It became clear very quickly to us that this was a big problem to tackle with huge potential and impact.<br></p>

                        <p>A landfill site is a site for the disposal of waste materials by burial. Landfills provide “out-of-sight-out-of-mind” rationality to the problem of waste management. After it leaves your home, most people ignore what happens to it. Once it is buried in a landfill, we are inclined to forget about it. This is a problem because all landfills have inherent problems related contaminants escaping and affecting our environment.<br>If recyclable materials are put into landfill sites you use more energy and resources trying to create new materials instead of re-using or recycling so landfill sites should not be the first port of call for re-usable or recyclable materials.</p>

                        <p>Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling). recycling aims at environmental sustainability by substituting raw material inputs into and redirecting waste outputs out of the economic system.</p>

                        <h6>What is the problem with recycling?</h6>
                        <p>Recycling is either a chemical process, mechanical process, thermal process, or a mix of the afore-mentioned. All these processes require special industrial facilities which in turn requires a whole factory. This in turn means transportation of the waste material. In addition, all the above-mentioned protocols are usually highly energy-consumpting which results in higher cost and makes it un-beneficial for most of the materials. </thead> </p>

                <h5>WHAT ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT?</h5>
                <p>Depending on the type of material, its thickness and weather conditions, the decomposition time of certain types of waste can be extremely long. For example, a glass bottle can take 4000 years to decompose. At landfills, the jumbled mess of waste is compressed which results in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter, a phenomenon that produces leachate and biogas. Directly flowing into the lakes and rivers, leachate can be severely harmful to wildlife and it can poison animals drinking such polluted water. Even though landfills should meet air-tight requirements to prevent soil and water pollution, leakages into the environment are an unfortunate inevitability. Plastic is versatile, lightweight, flexible, moisture resistant, strong, and relatively inexpensive. Those are the attractive qualities that lead us, around the world, to such a voracious appetite and over-consumption of plastic goods. However, durable and very slow to degrade, plastic materials that are used in the production of so many products all, ultimately, become waste with staying power.</p>

                        <p>Upcycling is the opposite of downcycling, which is the other face of the recycling process. Downcycling involves converting materials and products into new materials of lesser quality. Most recycling involves converting or extracting useful materials from a product and creating a different product or material. the goal of upcycling is to prevent wasting potentially useful materials by making use of existing ones. This reduces the consumption of new raw materials when creating new products. Reducing the use of new raw materials can result in a reduction of energy usage, air pollution, water pollution and even greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

                <h4>IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
                <p>In a non-standard process, each piece is unique. So first we need to know our material to extract data from it. Therefore we need to scan every piece of material. But for the industry, we will be dealing with a huge amount of material. So we need this system to be autonomous and reliable. Beside of that, the manual process is out of the question due to the scale.</p>

                    <p>To demonstrate this process we set up a system to implement this idea over an example of scrap woods. In our case, we deal with different shape of waste material. We extract the information into a database by autonomous scanning. Using a robotic arm to find the scrap and extract the data through remote sensing saving into a database and sorting the physical material through pick and place process.</p>
